# Chatroom

## Introduction 

To learn how to build distributed systems in Go, I am first implementing
this simple Chatroom project. I choose this project because this was the 
first lab for Cornell's *CS 5414: Principles of Distributed Systems*. 
This lab laid the groundwork for later projects, such as Three-Phase 
Commit and Paxos.

This Chatroom exercise will serve as the foundation for more complex
projects I envision, cumulating in a framework for composing distributed
services, i.e. Ovid.
